  <p>This course explained how to apply design techniquest to educational and training materials. Through the course, we studied effective tools for teaching and training, in both educational and business environments. Concepts covered included the principles of design for job aids, video, programming, and computer-based training.</p>
  <p>My final project for the course was an instructional site for how to use iMovie in a classroom setting. The site incorporated design and layout elements which I had learned in the class.</p>
