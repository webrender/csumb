  <p>This course helped students identify and articulate personal, professional, and social goals. It provided an integrated view of the TMAC major and its requirements, and had students develop a plan for their learning goals. </p>
  <p>My Project: The final project in this class was developing the learning plan and course track which I would be following leading up to my graduation. I chose to create a custom web development track, so that I could learn more about computer graphics and design, while still keeping a strong base in web programming and database management.</p>
