  <p>This course taught students to analyze, through an ethical perspective, how communication technology affects our lives. The course discussed individual and institutional values, represented through technological choices. Using case studies and current events, the course explored such issues as intellectual property rights, information access and privacy, and the digital divide.</p>
  <p>My final project for this class was to create a mini-site which analyzed one issue in ethics, in today's connected world. The topic which I chose was &quot;Ethics in Alternate Realities&quot;.</p>
