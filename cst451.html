  <p>This course tied together the ideas that I had learned in my other Web Design and Web Scripting courses to cover the process of designing a website, from start to finish. The class continued the development of skills taught in CST351, such as advanced JavaScript and DHTML, as well as bringing in skills learned in other classes, such as Actionscripting and Audio/Video streaming.</p>
  <p>The final project for the course was for each student to design a layout for a student events website. The website which I developed included a floating Flash menu layout, adjustment for variable width, and dynamic page changes. Note: The final project was only a layout, no programming - the link below only shows you a mock-up of the site - none of the content is implemented.</p>
