  <p class="style5">Ethical Frameworks</p>
  <p>The issue of taxing in-game assets is primarily based on money and how to tax and treat it, when it does not really &quot;exist&quot;, except in the game.  Therefore, I have tried to pick three ethical frameworks which deal with one's assets, and the assets of a society as a whole, in looking at my e-paper. <br>
  </p>
  <p><strong>Capitalism:</strong>  The principles of capitalism dictate that production should be privately owned, and that there should be a free market for goods based on supply and demand.  Some systems of capitalism say that &quot;legal frameworks&quot; (read:taxes) are required to prevent market failure, but most types of references to capitalism call for a truly free economy, citing the idea that markets will balance themselves if left unguided.  According to capitalism, then, taxing in-game goods would be a bad idea.  As far as we have seen thus far, in-economies seem to fare well, although if the game companies do not monitor illegal activites such as gold duping, the economy can inflate and become worthless.  So, according to the tenets of capitalism, we should leave in-game assets alone, because taxes are not needed for them to stay fair and balanced.</p>
  <p><strong>Globalization:</strong>  This framework essentially says that the world is getting smaller, and corporations are getting larger.  This, of course, is true, but the globalization attempts to organize these two things into a process through which companies can grow.  However, a virtual world is slightly different - the transactions and business that take place from day-to-day do not exist in our normal lives, they exist online in a meta-verse of information.  There are no real regions or areas;  people do not need homes or places to live.  I believe that, according to globalization, the taxation of assets in-game would lie squarely upon the game companies to manage their assets within the game, and not on localized governments.</p>
  <p><strong>Socialism:</strong>  Socialism in regards to online worlds would seem to support taxation as a means of distributing wealth.  However, we must look at the idea of a socialist society in the context of the game.  A socialist government and economy would take money from the rich and give to the poor (in it's most simple form), so that all people had an amount of money equal to the effort they put into the society.  However, is the &quot;government&quot; here referring to a real-life government, such as the United States, or Australia?  The U.S. taxes we pay go towards benefitting services in the United States, such as roads, schools, etc.  Shouldn't taxes paid in a world such as Second Life, go towards improving the life of those in the game (through items, hardware upgrades, etc.)? After all, that is the primary purpose of taxation, especially in a socialist economy - for the good of all peoples operating under that economy. </p>
