<td width="505">The United States and Online Assets
  <div align="left" class="style7">
    <p>While the issue of taxing virtual assets has only been a blip on the media radar, it has gotten quite a bit of coverage over the past few months.  The two biggest events concerning virtual taxes were the steps which Australia and the United States have taken towards studying and taxing these assets. <br>
      <br>
    The United States began their investigation of online assets with a Joint Economic Committee study of &quot;the public policy issues related to virtual economies&quot;.    The press release, despite being titled &quot; Virtual Economies Need Clarification, Not More Taxes,&quot; raised a lot of eyes and ears in the tech community, with people jumping to conclusions regarding in-game items being taxed without any transfer of assets to or from real-life.  The JEC press release describes the job of the commitee as the following:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;B<em>ased on existing law, if an individual generates cash income in U.S. dollars from transactions in virtual economies, the question may arise whether a tax is due on that real-world income. However, if the transaction takes place entirely within a virtual economy, then it seems there is no taxable event. Such distinctions should be addressed and resolved in a common-sense manner.&quot;</em></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Clearly, virtual economies represent an area where technology has outpaced the law. The goal of the forthcoming JEC study is to help lawmakers understand the issues involved and head off any premature attempt to impose a tax on virtual economies.&quot;</p>
  <p>So it seems that here in the U.S., we do not have much to worry about regarding our assets being taxed anytime soon.  However, this study mainly dealt with taxing items contained completely within a game or virtual world. For example, you find a sword for thousands of gold in-game.  Because you found the sword in-game, sold the sword in-game, and made in-game money from the sword, there are no real-life assets open to taxing.  However, the act of selling the character with the sword for &quot;real money&quot; is still being studied - the money you make is real income, and should be declared on taxes.  The media, following the announcement of the JEC committee, brought up a lot of good issues and &quot;grey areas&quot;.  What about long-term storing of funds in a game world?  Transactions worth hundreds of thousands of dollars have taken place within Second Life;  what's to keep the game from becoming a tax haven, where people can store their money without risk of tax - and if one plays the economy right, they could even increase the money invested. </p>

  <p class="style5">Meanwhile, in Australia...</p>
  <p>Australia's government has taken a more immediate response to the rise of online economies:  they have already determined that any income made, real or virtual, in a virtual world, is taxable and should be reported on one's tax returns.  Specifically, the report cites World of Warcraft and Second Life (The two largest virtual worlds, currently) as having assets which should be reported for taxes.  The Australian Tax Office (ATO) has this to say:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em>&quot;The real world value of a transaction may form part of your taxable income, even if it is in Linden dollars.&quot;</em></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Clearly, different countries have different opinions on whether or not virtual assets should be taxed, and at what point.  Britain has stated that it is taking a &quot;wait-and-see&quot; approach before it makes and decisions regarding virtual assets.</p>

  <p>The media coverage of all these events is relatively huge, given the scope of this matter in real world events.  This is partially related to the Reuters news bureau located within the second life game.  With staffed reporters and editors, the site operates as any news bureau world, except its dealings are completely with the game and its effects on life.  Because MMOs are such a new technology, much of the information about current events echoes throughout the blogs of the internet - it's hard to miss an article when 12 different sites are posting about it.  This helps to keep the participants in these communities stay in the know regarding taxes and charges which may be imposed. </p>
