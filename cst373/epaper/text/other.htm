  <p>The primary group concerned with this issue is, obviously, those who already participate in a virtual world such as Second Life or World of Warcraft.  The taxing of online goods is an especially pressing issue in Second Life, even moreso than WoW (despite its smaller subscriber base), because the game has an official U.S. Dollar-to-Linden Dollar exchange rate;  one can buy L$ straight from the Second Life site, and have it ingame.  In most MMOs, such as World of Warcraft, the buying and selling of goods is illegal, and Blizzard Entertainment (proprietors of the WoW service) makes every attempt to stop real-world transactions from occurring. </p>
  <p>Most of the articles which I researched for this assignment were found through the internet, and most of these articles on the internet had a space after the article for readers to leave their own thoughts and opinions.  Those opinions seemed to be a unanimous scowl from the faces of virtual world habitats everywhere.  Many of them were misinformed, thinking that the U.S. was already going to be writing bills to tax money you make ingame (The U.S.' committee is simply looking into these transactions;  as mentioned on the history page, the JEC group has no intention of proposing taxes). Those who did have their info straight still discouraged such a bill, citing scenarios such as</p>
  <ul>
    <li>gold duping (copying items)</li>
    <li>fluctuating economies between servers</li>
    <li>paying real taxes with ingame money (opposite situation)</li>
    <li>The difference between WoW gold and Monopoly money...</li>
    </ul>
  <p> the list goes on. Some of the comments (like the monopoly one) have little backing to support them. Other ideas, such as the issue of gold duping and fluctuating economies, are real issues which will have to be taken into account once more countries, especially the United States, begin taking serious steps to a system which tracks and taxes in-game expenses. </p>
