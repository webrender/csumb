  <p class="style8">Discussion Topics</p>
  <p class="style2">1. Should in-game assets be taxed, if those assets remain in-game? What about income earned ingame? If a person buys $2,000 worth of money in Second Life, and turns that into $10,000 through the use of the game, should he be taxed on the income he has made? </p>
  <p class="style2">2. Imagine that you are in the future, and that assets from these games are to be taxed. Does the responsibility of collecting those taxes lie on the players of the game, or those who run it? When you play World of Warcraft or Second Life, you do not technically &quot;own&quot; anything - you have simply licensed the rights to manage a character on that companies servers. So, should the game producers collect the money through a live, ingame taxation system? Or should declaring one's profit lie in the hands of the players themselves, despite them not &quot;owning&quot; anything. Why?</p>
  <p class="style2">3. Imagine the same scenario as listed above: governments have chosen to start taxing ingame assets. What do you think is the role of IT Professionals, as stewards of information, in ensuring that income is reported and taxed properly? There are companies with virtual bureaus in second life, what is your opinion on an in-game &quot;taxman&quot;, one with the ability to audit and notify people of game taxation issues? Should they be an IT professional working for a privately-contracted company, or should these people employed by the governments which wish to monitor their spending. What about in-game audits? Do these governments have the right to view our in-game spending habits if they question our virtual tax returns? </p>
