  <p>Future Challenges</p>
  <p>The issue of in-game assets will only grow larger as time passes, and more and more people begin to participate in online worlds.  Right now, virtual currencies such as Linden Dollars and WoW gold are rather minor compared to real world currency markets, like the Dollar, Yen, and Euro.  However, what happens in 20 years, when these in-game economies have started to rival real-world money.  There are already games which have built-in pizza restaurant directories, for when you're too busy playing to go make food.  What happens when these companies start accepting virtual currency as a means of payment for real world goods?  Right now, the only thing tax organizations have to worry about is ingame to money transactions - you still need cold hard cash right now to buy that pizza.  What happens when you eliminate the middleman, and that middleman just so happens to be the U.S. dollar? The economy would surely feel a hit, and how would people react to the source of that hit being a virtual economy?  Take this into account as well:  right now, we are seeing the first cases of MMO addicton, and clinics are already being opened around the world to handle internet addiction.  How much of a threat to real life are virtual worlds going to be in 20, or 50 years?  When people haveno assets in real life, and everything they value exists ingame, what happens then.</p>
