  <p class="style5">My Reflections </p>
  <p>The whole idea of taxing in-game assets seems a little strange to me, personally.  While the Monopoly allusion cited in a previous page doesn't exactly fit, it does represent how I initially felt towards the issue;  this is a game that people play for fun - why would you try and tax it? </p>
  <p>After doing research on this paper and reading other opinions towards virtual taxation, I still do not think that governments should tax these assets, but for different reasons.  These worlds that people exist in are just that - WORLDS - not the United States, not North America, not even Earth.  What right does the U.S. government have to take our personal, real world assets from a world nowhere near being in their jurisdiction?  Many people, like me, play online games, and really don't have much money in real life.  How are you going to tax this person with real fines, when he might only be rich in the game world.  If anything, governments should tax the virtual world creators, for creating an economy which challenges that of a real-world government.  It can then be in the hands of those creators, essentially the gods and governments of their worlds, to handle taxing those people in-game to cover losses, if they should decide to do so.  As I mentioned in the Future Challenges section, this will become an even larger issue once real-life companies start accepting virtual currency to pay for their goods.  This should not be a question of players vs. their real-world governments.  Instead, this should be an issue between two competing economies, for how those economies are managed will determine the future of online currency and value.</p>
