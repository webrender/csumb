So to truly understand the origins of online business, we must look back briefly to the origin of these programs.</p>      
        <p>The earliest MMO (Massively Multiplayer Online) experience started in the late 1970s - with Multi User Dungeons, also known as MUDs.  MUDs were completely text based user areas, where people could play the game via text commands, and receive descriptions of their situations in return.  The gameplay usually resembled Dungeons and Dragons, a real-life role playing game. </p>
        <p>Soon after, and throughout the 80s, true MMOs started coming to market, with graphics slowly appearing and becoming more complex.  The first MMO to truly make people pay attention was Neverwinter Nights, created in 1991, with an online service supported by AOL.  However, in the early 90s, there were still restrictions on what could be posted to the Internet, and so the game was only available on the AOL network. However, once the restrictions on internet content were removed later in the 90s, MMOs started to come to fruition. New, more powerful computer systems made more complex games available to the public, and new servers made it easier for MMOs to host more players. </p>
        <p>Let's go back to MUDs for a second - those text-based, multi user dungeons.  Another, separate type of application branched off from these, around the same time that MMOs were getting their wings.  These programs were called &quot;virtual worlds&quot;, and they were similar to MMOs - with the key exception of gameplay, or lack thereof.  Some of the first virtual worlds were WorldsAway and The Palace, in 2D, and quickly expanded to 3D worlds such as ActiveWorlds in 1991.  However, because it's harder to find a niche audience for a virtual world than it is for a computer game, virtual worlds took slightly longer to catch on. In 2003, the most popular (to date) virtual world was made, known as Second Life.  The game reflected several facets of real life, such as an in-game economy, businesses, and social interaction.  The simplicity of the design, as well as the freedom to create custom &quot;items&quot; to sell, made the world a success.</p>
        <p>Fast forward to 2006.  World of Warcraft is the largest MMO ever, and the 4th best selling game in history, claiming over 7 million subscribers.  Second Life is the most sucessful virtual world experience, complete with sexual interaction, a Reuters news bureau, and dozens of real-life businesses making an in-game presence (Dell and IBM are the two latest to create Second Life facilities). </p>
        <p>Until 2005, the issue of taxing virtual goods was almost non-existant - for the most part, people make money in-game, spend the money on items in-game, and trade with other players in-game. However, the new popularity of these games is what has caused in-game economies and markets to be such an upcoming ethical issue.  Linden Dollars(L$), the official currency of Second Life, has a direct currency to dollar exchange rate, and one can purchase L$ directly from Linden Labs, the company which runs Second Life.  Blizzard Entertainment, the proprietors of World of Warcraft, do  not support the buying or selling of goods outside of the game world. However, if you do a search for &quot;Warcraft Gold&quot;, it will become clear that Blizzard cannot do much to stop this - items, gold, and even entire accounts are sold online, sometimes upwards of $1000.  The populations of Second Life and World of Warcraft combined would be somewhere near the equivalent of the population of New York.  When this many people start to buy and sell goods in the game, both ingame and real money, a few heads in politics and business would be bound to turn.</p>
        <p>The first governments to have looked seriously at taxing online assets have been the United States, and Australia.  The issue of taxing in-game assets has come and gone to the House, which created a Joint Economic Committee (JEC) to study the economies in virtual worlds, and how transactions made in them should be handled. However, Jim Saxton, the leader of the JEC, has said that the purpose of the committee is mainly to help lawmakers understand the issues involved, and to help head off premature attempts at taxing virtual economies.  Australia's government, on the other hand, has declared virtual assets taxable income.  The law currently in Australia declares that &quot;If you are getting a monetary benefit, then it's not treated any differently - normal rules apply. </p>
        <p>Only the future will tell how these online economies will grow, and how taxing of them will change in the future.  As these virtual economies become larger and larger, and the economy actually starts being used to save money through tax evasion, more governments and businesses will begin to take note.  Taxes and online worlds have only just begun to clash in the past two years, and the future of MMOs don't look like theyr'e getting any dimmer.</p>
