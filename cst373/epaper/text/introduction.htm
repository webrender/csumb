      <p>My name is Jeremy Laskar, and I will confess that I am addicted to the internet. At school, my assignments require the use of it. At work, my tasks require me to utilize its knowledge. And then, there is home. Each night I come home to two computers and three screens, and at least one of them has a web browser, a media player, a chat window on it - some connection to the World Wide Web and the Internet..</p>
      <p>One of the newest &quot;sections&quot; of the internet, if you will, is the space occupied by Alternate Reality Experiences. Once simply text based games, played by multiple people, these simple activites have evolved into programs like Second Life, and games like World of Warcraft. However, these are just fantasy worlds that users coexist in. Everything in them is &quot;made up&quot;. But what happens when your avatar suffers losses in these virtual worlds? Gets hurt? And what about the value of this world - the public and the media is just beginning to realize that these virtual assets have real world values associated with them. In this e-paper, for CST373 - Ethics and Technology, I will be looking at the impact that virtual actions have on real people, and how it relates to ethical values in life. The two main topics I will be covering are:</p>
      <p><strong>Are real people responsible for their virtual assets? Are, and can there be real life reprocussions for virtual actions?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Virtual items have meaning to those people who &quot;own&quot; them - should these assets have value in real life? Should these assets be taxable? </strong></p>
