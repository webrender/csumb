  <p>This course let my peers and I refine and develop our skills as digital artists, using a variety of mediums. Using current software and hardware methods, we took a variety of source materials, including hand drawings, photographs, and used image editing tools to transform them into provocative and perosnal visual statements. These projects were done in a variety of medias, including paper, canvas, and digital delivery methods. </p>
  <p>For my project in this class, I used vector imaging techniques and Flash animation, to create a short piece depicting the journey from CSUMB up to the city of San Francisco. The movie was created by taking still frames of areas, vectorizing, and then animating them.</p>
