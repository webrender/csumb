  <p>This course is ITCD's Community Service section, in which students apply computer literacy, multimedia design, and technology knowledge to assist schools, nonprofit organizations, and community agencies. The theme for the class was &quot;Bridging the Digital Divide&quot;, and I served 30 hours with the Boys &amp; Girls Club of Seaside, assisting them with technology skills instruction, as well as design work. </p>
  <p>The final project for this class was an analysis of my site and it's technology resources, as well as a paper documenting the work and improvements I had made for my service site in bridging the Digital Divide.</p>
