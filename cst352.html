  <p>This course complemented the Web Design course, to teach web programming skills, specifically using a MySQL/PHP programming environment. Students in the course learned the skills required to create dynamic websites through PHP, as well as how to apply proper layout and planning to projects. Topics taught in the class included dynamic HTML scripting, PHP, MySQL database creation and management, and open source philosophy. </p>
  <p>The final project in this course was to create a personalized web application which used the MySQL programming we had learned in the course. For my project, I chose to script a rankings system for the game World of Warcraft. Not only was the project a success, but the rankings code has been further developed and is still being used today.</p>
