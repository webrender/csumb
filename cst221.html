  <p>In this course, I learned Flash Actionscripting and applied solid programming techniques to create dynamic multimedia content. Concepts I learned in this course included fundamentals of Object Oriented Programming, as well as the designing, coding, testing, debugging, and documenting of computer programs. </p>
  <p>For my final project in this course, i used Flash and Actionscript to create an interactive tutorial about computer customization. The project includes actionscripting which handles Audio/Video, transitions, and data parsing. This project was done for both this class, and CST201: Media Tools.</p>
