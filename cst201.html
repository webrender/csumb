  <p>This course served as an introduction to the ITCD major, introducing us to the tools and hardware which we would be using over the course of our studies. The class centered around multimedia authoring using a variety of mediums: audio, video, motion, text, images, and sound. The final deliverable for the course was a multimedia project which integrated all the different techniques we had learned in the course.</p>
  <p>My final in CST221: Actionscripting doubled as the final in this class, an interactive guide on customizing your computer.</p>
